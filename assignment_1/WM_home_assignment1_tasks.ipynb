    "# Webmining - Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Home Assignment** is to be submitted and you will be given points for each of the tasks. It familiarizes you with basics of *web crawling* and standard text preprocessing. It then takes a deep dive into *GloVe* one approach for obtaining word embeddings. To train GloVe we will frist construct the co-occurence matrix and then we will use adaptive stochastic gradient descent to minimize the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formalities\n",
    "**Submit in a group of 2-3 people until 27.05.2020 23:59CET. The deadline is strict!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation and Grading\n",
    "General advice for programming excercises at *CSSH*:\n",
    "Evaluation of your submission is done semi automatically. Think of it as this notebook being \n",
    "executed once. Afterwards, some test functions are appended to this file and executed respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "* Submit valid _Python3_ code only!\n",
    "* Use external libraries only when specified by task.\n",
    "* Ensure your definitions (functions, classes, methods, variables) follow the specification if\n",
    "  given. The concrete signature of e.g. a function usually can be inferred from task description, \n",
    "  code skeletons and test cases.\n",
    "* Ensure the notebook does not rely on current notebook or system state!\n",
    "  * Use `Kernel --> Restart & Run All` to see if you are using any definitions, variables etc. that \n",
    "    are not in scope anymore.\n",
    "  * Double check if your code relies on presence of files or directories other than those mentioned\n",
    "    in given tasks. Tests run under Linux, hence don't use Windows style paths \n",
    "    (`some\\path`, `C:\\another\\path`). Also, use paths only that are relative to and within your\n",
    "    working directory (OK: `some/path`, `./some/path`; NOT OK: `/home/alice/python`, \n",
    "    `../../python`).\n",
    "* Keep your code idempotent! Running it or parts of it multiple times must not yield different\n",
    "  results. Minimize usage of global variables.\n",
    "* Ensure your code / notebook terminates in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There's a story behind each of these points! Don't expect us to fix your stuff!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the scores, you will get no points for a task if:\n",
    "- your function throws an unexpected error (e.g. takes the wrong number of arguments)\n",
    "- gets stuck in an infinite loop\n",
    "- takes much much longer than expected (e.g. >1s to compute the mean of two numbers)\n",
    "- does not produce the desired output (e.g. returns an descendingly sorted list even though we asked for ascending, returns the mean and the std even though we asked for only the mean, prints an output instead of returning it, ...)"
